Ooluroo is a responsive website built on Wordpress I developed while working at [Domani Studios][domani]. It features rich CSS3 animations and a level of polish needed to convey a tech focused and seamless message. Built using Wordpress [Pods][pods] and [Advanced Custom Field][acf] groups, it supports many different content types and is able to scale as this emerging brand releases new details about their product.
